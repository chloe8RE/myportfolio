    "1. Based on model comparison, the best fit model is Random Forest model with RMSE of 186. This model is able to handle complex relationship of features and predict seasonality from limited historical data due to its robust algorithms and hyperparameter tuning features.  It also extract features importance with payment method 'easypay' being the highest importance followed by discount and pricing.\n",
