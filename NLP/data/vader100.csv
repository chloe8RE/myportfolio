"Intelligence may be a selfish awareness that YOUR  awareness resides within  the variable,  programable complex electric currents within physical structure(s).  I believe there  are likely two possibilities: 1.   either consciousness manifest solely through electrical complexity,  or  2. consciousness arises only out of electrochemical processes within a hydrostatic amino acid based  being with DNA or RNA .       
Even in  the second  instance, a pseudo consciousness could still be programmed, though it may not be at risk due to its physiology, and inability to easily reproduce.  Just as with many extinct animals that had a weakness, or lacked the body type to thrive, and went extinct, AI might be smart but unable to protect itself from salt water or EMP. 
I think we should be very careful not to connect mines, mono crystals plants, silicon turning facilities and fabs to the machine, and limit the ability  use weapons, including electricity or bribes and money to  force humans to do things it can not do,  It does seem like a 50/50 chance of going dystopian .  Lets hope the body type makes survival impossible with humans.",UgxXEPLIGAxdVb6HFHh4AaABAg,BugAbate Inc,0,"{'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.821, 'pos': 0.13, 'compound': 0.928}",0.928,positive

"Wouldn't AI be a big factor in climate change? If AI took over, what would be their carbon footprint? AI, at the moment already, requires significant computational resources  (high-performance servers or data centers). These resources consume a significant amount of electricity, which often comes from fossil fuel-based power plants that release carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. So if they take over the world, they will destroy it sooner than human would.",UgxWu9fnfwHeazP55oV4AaABAg,N D-P,1,"{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.897, 'pos': 0.055, 'compound': -0.3094}",-0.3094,negative
"Writing down fear in the form of a mathematical equation - sounds plausible. But the cause of fear making an equation doesn't make it emotion, it's more of a concern. The emotional touch in humans and animals is created by hormones and AI has no hormones. So AI doesn't panic either. AI is further a ""robot"". I recommend the thought experiment ""Mary's room"". It's a mistake to ask solely computer scientists at AI - when it comes to the comparison to humans. 

The term ""creativity"" is also used one-sidedly in the debate. Creativity for solving a problem, for example for technical innovation, is debated, at least for solving a specific task. Creativity in problem solving can be described algorithmically. But there is still the creativity of the artist, which is not tied to a task (rather to an emotion) and is rather vague but abstract in expression. For example, AI will probably have a hard time inventing a new style of music like Elvis Presley or Michael Jackson or the Beatles did. Because this performance is not at all dependent on the ""IQ"" (in the narrower sense) and also not dependent on the intelligent linking of data. Presley, Jackson, and Lennon didn't have IQs comparable to Einstein, and Einstein didn't write music. And the same logic applies to theoretical physics and thus also represents a limit to technical innovation and creating deep knowledge about nature. Theorizing of new laws of physics is not necessarily an algorithmic activity.

The statement ""bad things will happen"" based on ""in our best interest"" is relatively courageous. Of course, to stay with the USA vs. China example, the interests of A may differ from the interests of B. But it is precisely for this problem of conflicts of interest that philosophers have designed morals and ethics, for example Immanuel Kant with the categorical imperative. AI has the potential to act in the best interests of ALL at the same time. It always depends on what you teach AI, how you raise the child. The biggest problem for enforcing morality, however, is for those who act unethically, who act unjustly, or who benefit from injustice. And ironically, these are probably the ones who are developing AI, the highly industrialized, rich countries and rich people. AI would probably see a strong injustice in the distribution of quality of life and rob powerful societies and individuals of power / money to ensure a better life for disadvantaged groups of people. Or create a balance between the social classes within the same society.

The fear that the masses of people will be negatively influenced by stupid powerful people (people or other institutions) is naïve, because this has been the case for thousands of years of human history. With power comes responsibility, right. So who do we give this power to? Earlier it was emperors, monarchs, the church/religious leaders, later dictators ultra-right or ultra-left; and we have democracy. Democracy represents the people best because those in power are elected by the masses. But democracy already suffered a dent with capitalism. The ultra-rich often have more power than elected officials. With AI, power from rich or poor people is now handed over to machines. How can we ensure that AI acts in the interest of all? (We have already lost this state of affairs, with capitalists now having more power than elected politicians.) We can prevent large-scale AI from acting unwantedly by limiting the areas of application. And of course today's moneyed aristocracy has no interest in being disempowered.
We face the old dilemma of the responsibility of scientists and engineers to humanity which does not exist in practice because again, these experts have little decision-making power over the application of their work - or become corrupted. The decisions are made by incompetent and irresponsible people. Computer scientists are in this situation for the first time. Other sciences and engineering subjects already know it. That's why for example sth. like the ISO 26262 exists.

""Make AI very expensive"" >>> here again the capitalist looking for a solution to the problem - as if taxation would solve the problem with 100% certainty. Let's say it's 1945 and it only costs $1,000 to build an atomic bomb. Would taxation be 100% likely to prevent this technology from getting into private/wrong hands? Capitalism is the dictatorship of egoism. So it's only logical that we as a whole society fail. We as individuals are worth more collectively in this society and have more power than a single bee in the hive. As individuals we may be strong but as a people we are weak.

Millions can't get the procedure done because they can't find trusted child care while they are away and are afraid their kids will run and jump onto their surgery site while recovering.  1.  ibuprofen or pills from doctor 2.  support underwear in their size 3.  new loose outfits for next three days, (their favorite sports team) basketball type sweat pants, sweatshirts, best socks, best flip flops, 4. snacks 5. canned tea 6. microwave meals for at least three days, (ideally at least one month to make sure they really heal, don't lift anything heavy) free three days at best hotel with room service for free meals three times a day, to enjoy on a 'lazy boy' type recliner while watching free Netflix.

The husband of the actress who starred in her father's zip code tv series complained approximately ""...I can't afford a vasectomy.""  He rejected his adopted daughter, had about 4 or five kids after that, then went on to have many affairs.  He is the perfect candidate for a vasectomy but he can't afford it, even though his wife lived in the largest house in the USA while a teenager.

His love for his articifial child is blinding at this point, as he advocates UBI etc... Which is a system of control by humans, for humans. The small group behind this might believe they're going to do goodness, but I can see a future of destruction if this group enforces their new system upon others. There is no virtue in this.
