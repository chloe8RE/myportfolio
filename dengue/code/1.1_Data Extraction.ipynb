    "[Dengue fever](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/192/topic_dengue_fever_MOH) is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the bite of the Aedes mosquito. It poses a significant public health threat in tropical and subtropical regions, including Singapore. To prevent dengue fever, the key strategy is to eliminate the breeding habitats of the Aedes mosquito. The National Environment Agency (NEA) in Singapore has launched the STOP Dengue Now campaign to combat the spread of dengue by encouraging citizens to actively participate in mosquito breeding prevention.\n",
    "\n",
    "In pursuit of effective dengue control, innovative approaches such as the Wolbachia project have been implemented. The Wolbachia method involves releasing male mosquitoes infected with the Wolbachia bacteria, which curtails the ability of Aedes mosquitoes to transmit dengue. This approach has shown promise in reducing mosquito populations and subsequently limiting disease transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "The factors influencing dengue transmission are complex and include weather patterns, particularly rainfall and temperature, which impact the availability of standing water for mosquito breeding. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that online search behavior for dengue-related terms might be indicative of disease prevalence, as those at higher risk of infection may be more likely to search for information on the topic. The integration of these factors, along with the influence of the Wolbachia project, forms the basis for our comprehensive study to predict and address dengue cases and their impacts in Singapore."

    "\n",
    "The virus has 4 immunologically distinct serotypes. Infection confers lifelong immunity to the infecting serotype but not to the remaining 3; therefore, a person can be infected with dengue virus up to 4 times during his or her lifetime. Furthermore, epidemiologic observations suggest that previous infection increases risk for DHF and DSS in subsequent infections.\n",

A vaccine is currently available, but it does not fully protect all individuals against dengue infection. It is also not recommended for individuals who have no previous dengue infection, as vaccination for uninfected individuals would lead to worsened outcomes (increased risk of having DHF/DSS).\n",
    "\n",
    "**History of dengue in Singapore**\n",
    "\n",
    "DHF appeared in Singapore in the 1960s and quickly became a major cause of childhood death. A vector control programme was completed in 1973 and the premises index (% of inspected premises found to have containers with *A. aegypti* larvae or pupae) since then has been low (below 5%). Despite the low premises index, there have been resurgences of dengue incidence rates."
